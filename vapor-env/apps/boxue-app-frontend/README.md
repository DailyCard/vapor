# Boxue

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/puretears/boxue-app-frontend.svg?token=zeBELcAjkXJHjpNp4pUP&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/puretears/boxue-app-frontend)

[Boxue](https://boxueio.com) is a 4K screencast website for independent app developers. In 2018, we want to launch and open source our own iOS app. This is the front end part which will be built on swift and [here](https://github.com/puretears/boxue-app-backend) is the server side which will be based on [Swift Vapor](https://vapor.codes/).

# Coding Style

Here's [a living coding style guide](https://google.github.io/swift) about Swift from Google. You are encouraged to conform to this guideline when PR any Swift code.

# Design

The design of Boxue should conform to the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/). Before getting your hands dirty, make sure read the doc first.

## Screencasts

In case you are not good at design, we record some episodes to help you have some knowledge of colors, fonts and basic sketch operations.

* [Color basics](https://boxueio.com/series/color-basics)
* [Sketch basics](https://boxueio.com/series/sketch-basics)

And the following series talks about the designing process of Boxue app on iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch:

* [Design Boxue app on iPhone from scratch](https://boxueio.com/series/design-boxue-app-from-scratch)

## Resources

In this section, you can find all resources used in the project.

## UI dashboard

You can find and discuss all UI design with us at the [Zeplin dashboard](https://app.zeplin.io/project/5b0e3b4cd8ad154e4e21ecaf).

### Font

We use the [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts) as the English UI font and *PingFang SC* as the Simplified Chinese UI font.

### UI template

Here are some useful iOS UI templates:

* [iOS 11 iPhone GUI by facebook](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fbdesignresources/iOS+11/Facebook+iOS+11+Sketch.zip)
* [Device framers](https://facebook.design/devices)
* [iOS DesignKit](https://iosdesignkit.io/)

### Sketch plugins

We use the following Sketch plugins to make our design life easier:

* [Runner](https://sketchrunner.com): It's the missing plugin manager on Sketch;
* [Measure](https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure): It helps us to create spec for developers;
* [Auto Layout](https://github.com/AnimaApp/Auto-Layout): A plugin makes our design more accurate and responsive;
* [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/sketch): A plugin that can optimize your image size at 80%. Do not forget to install the [ImageOptim app](https://imageoptim.com/mac);
* [SF-UI-Font-Fixer](https://github.com/puretears/Sketch-SF-UI-Font-Fixer): A Sketch plugin that adjusts the character spacing on text layers using iOS's SF UI Display fonts;
* [Palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes): We use it to manage colors in Apple's HIG and Google material colors;
* [IconFont](https://github.com/keremciu/sketch-iconfont): It helps us to insert and manage icons from icon fonts easily. After installation, don't forget to install [the font bundles](https://github.com/keremciu/font-bundles) as well;
* [Artboard Manager](https://github.com/bomberstudios/artboard-manager): It help us arrange all artboards automatically;
* [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/): It helps us to generate styleguides and resources automatically which makes the hand-off never been easier. You can also download [the native app](https://zpl.io/download-mac) to manage your design dashboard;
* [Craft](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft): We use it to manage all styles, fonts and resources. It saves us lots of time in conforming to the design guidelines;
* [Midnight](https://midnightsketch.com/): Before the release of official native dark mode of Sketch, this gorgeous plugin already offers a dark mode experience and more. And if you work on Mojave, Sketch 52 has a native dark mode :);

We will update more Sketch plugins while we finish more UI design.
